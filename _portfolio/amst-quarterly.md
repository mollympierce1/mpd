excerpt: "We were given the opportunity to reimagine the look of the Art Museum of South Texas‘ quarterly newsletter, drawing inspiration from the pieces showcased in “El Color del Ser: Dorothy Hood”. Using a rich color palette, clean lines and simplistic typography, we blended the heady sensation of Hood’s work with the crisp aesthetics of AMST’s architecture."
