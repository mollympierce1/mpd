Downtown Corpus Christi standby Rockit’s came under new ownership last year, and they gave it a total makeover. We worked together to give them a modern, moody, throwback-inspired new website to match their clean new look. We drew our inspiration from music, old-school Corpus Christi, and fine whiskey.
