Industrial Fabricators of Corpus Christi is a leading steel service center with fabricating and machining capabilities. Under the same ownership since 1977, IndFab was seeking a refreshed web presence to better represent their established and growing brand. To accurately present the business online, HRMG found it crucial to photograph and capture their team of over 100 employees working on their 20 acres, or 185,000 square foot, facility. This project was a terrific opportunity to utilize our drone to capture the immense capacity that IndFab offers their clients.

What resulted from our efforts was an updated logo, an interactive homepage with aerial footage and a video of the fabrication of their logo, personalized photography of projects underway and a mobile-ready responsive website house on our dedicated server.
