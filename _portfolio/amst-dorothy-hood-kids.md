To accompany the opening of their groundbreaking exhibit, The Color of Being/ El Color del Ser: DOROTHY HOOD (1918-2000), the Art Museum of South Texas commissioned us to design this activity book for their educational outreach programs. Using Texas artist Dorothy Hood’s rich color palette, 'Meet Dorothy Hood' tells the story of Dorothy Hood’s life and work, and inspires kids to ignite the artists within themselves.
