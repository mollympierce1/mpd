excerpt: "Corpus Christi’s favorite outdoor live music venue, Concrete Street, was ready for a fresh online look. Their old website didn’t quite live up to the quality of acts that they feature on their stages. We rebranded and came up with a new website presence that is a little bit rock n’ roll, a little bit grunge."
