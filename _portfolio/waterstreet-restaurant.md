<h1>Waterstreet Oyster Bar</h1>
<h6>Graphic Design, Menu Design, Logo Design</h6>
<p>I partnered with WaterStreet Market to revamp the Oyster Bar Menus. They were looking to shift the branding of their three different restaurant concepts according to their individual schemes and environments. I reworked the Oyster Bar logo as a throwback to the “Oyster O” they used when the restaurant first opened. The new menus complete the Oyster Bar dining experience – a sleek, industrial, Corpus Christi staple.</p>
